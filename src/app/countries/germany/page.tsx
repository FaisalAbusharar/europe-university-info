        European students applying to German universities benefit from no tuition fees for bachelor’s and master’s programs, with courses primarily conducted in German. Bachelor’s programs require a high school diploma qualifying for higher education in their home country (e.g., Abitur or equivalent). Master’s programs typically require a bachelor’s degree in a related field, and some may require work experience. Some programs may include entrance exams, interviews, or a portfolio review. Non-native German speakers generally need to demonstrate language proficiency through exams like <a href="https://www.testdaf.de/de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="hyperlink">TestDaF</a>, <a href="https://en.dsh-germany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="hyperlink">DSH</a>, or <a href="https://www.goethe.de/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="hyperlink">Goethe-Zertifikat</a>. For English-taught programs, proficiency in English is often required, with exams like <a href="https://ielts.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="hyperlink">IELTS</a>, <a href="https://www.ets.org/toefl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="hyperlink">TOEFL</a>, or <a href="https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/test-your-english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="hyperlink">Cambridge</a> being accepted.
